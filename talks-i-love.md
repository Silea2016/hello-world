Bill Gates's house is a large mansion that overlooks Lake Washington in Medina, Washington, United States of America. The 66,000-square-foot (6,100 m2) mansion is noted for its design and the technology it incorporates. It is nicknamed Xanadu 2.0 after the title character's estate in Citizen Kane. It took seven years to build and cost $63.2 million.

In 2009, property taxes were reported to be US $1.063 million on a total assessed value of US$147.5 million.

Design and features
The house was the result of a collaboration between Bohlin Cywinski Jackson Architects (based in Pennsylvania but with satellite offices in Seattle and San Francisco) and Cutler-Anderson Architects of Bainbridge Island, Washington. Neither company's website currently has information or images of the house, perhaps due to Gates's privacy and security concerns.

The mansion is a modern design in the Pacific Lodge style, with classic features such as a big private library with a dome shaped roof and oculus. The house also features an estate-wide server system, a 60-foot (18 m) swimming pool with an underwater music system, a 2,500-square-foot (230 m2) gym, a 1,000-square-foot (93 m2) dining room, and heated floors and driveways. Guests wear pins that automatically adjust temperature, music, and lighting based on their preferences upon entering a room. It is also an earth-sheltered house.
