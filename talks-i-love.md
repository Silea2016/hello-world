Design and features
The house was the result of a collaboration between Bohlin Cywinski Jackson Architects (based in Pennsylvania but with satellite offices in Seattle and San Francisco) and Cutler-Anderson Architects of Bainbridge Island, Washington. Neither company's website currently has information or images of the house, perhaps due to Gates's privacy and security concerns.

The mansion is a modern design in the Pacific Lodge style, with classic features such as a big private library with a dome shaped roof and oculus. The house also features an estate-wide server system, a 60-foot (18 m) swimming pool with an underwater music system, a 2,500-square-foot (230 m2) gym, a 1,000-square-foot (93 m2) dining room, and heated floors and driveways. Guests wear pins that automatically adjust temperature, music, and lighting based on their preferences upon entering a room. It is also an earth-sheltered house.
